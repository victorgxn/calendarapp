# Calendar App Front
This is a simple calendar project implemented using React and Redux Toolkit. The main goal of this project is to learn and practice the use of global states, custom hooks, API integration with axios, and state management with Redux Toolkit in a React application. This application integrates with a backend that was programmed using Node js, Express and MongoDB which is located in another repository [Backend Calendar App repository link]( https://github.com/victorgxn/calendarapp-back). 
 
### Features

- User Authentication: Users can create a custom account and then login to access the app and manage their events securely.

- Detailed calendar view: Allows the user to view events and activities in a clean and organised calendar where you can change its appearance (diary, daily, weekly and monthly).

- Add, edit and remove your own events:** Users can add new events to the calendar, as well as update and remove their own existing event details.

- Viewing other people's events:** Users can view other people's events, facilitating coordination and group planning.
